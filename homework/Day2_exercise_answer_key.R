#### Clustering
# After loading seurat_integrated.RData, set the resolution to 0.4, and plot the UMAP. How many clusters are present in our data?
# 13

#### Clustering quality control
# Hypothesize the clusters corresponding to each of the different clusters in the table:
# Cell Type	Clusters
# CD14+ monocytes	1, 3, 14
# FCGR3A+ monocytes	9
# Conventional dendritic cells	15
# Plasmacytoid dendritic cells	19
# Marcrophages	-
# B cells	6, 11, 17
# T cells	0, 2, 4, 5, 10, 13, 18
# CD4+ T cells	0, 2, 4, 10, 18
# CD8+ T cells	5, 13
# NK cells	8, 12
# Megakaryocytes	16
# Erythrocytes -
# Unknown	7, 20
