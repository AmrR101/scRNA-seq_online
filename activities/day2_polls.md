  1. When evaluating the relationship between the nUMIs and the number of genes detected we examine  the slope of the line, and any scatter of data points in the bottom right hand quadrant of the plot.
  1. Mitochondrial counts ratio can identify whether there is a large amount of mitochondrial contamination from dead or dying cells.
  1. Cells with a low novelty score are those that have a less complex RNA species than other cells. 


2. **True or False** If a sample fails to meet the threshold for any one quality metric, it is best to discard it before moving forward.
